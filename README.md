Many of the Win32 Headers outside are quit out of date. Most of them don't have Vista, Win7, Win8 or Win10 support.
So the time has come for a new approach to translate the headers to pascal...

Use the Win32.WinAPI.inc to define what version the headers should support at compile time. This approach tries to 
be as close as possible at the original MS headers.

Btw, since this are ** many ** header files, help is welcome :)
